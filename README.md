# IETF Repo Files

This repository contains files and templates for [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)
working group chairs and participants to use in GitHub repositories used for
IETF work.

  * [`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md) is the official boilerplate text to be included
    in all IETF repositories, per the [IETF
    Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org/license-for-open-source-repositories.html).
    (Automatically updated.)

  * [`NOTE-WELL.md`](NOTE-WELL.md) is the text of the [IETF note
    well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) as Markdown, if you should need
    it. (Automatically updated.)

  * It is customary to include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in a repo that explains
    how individuals can participate in the activities and contains additional
    useful information for participants to be aware of. Due to the specific
    nature of the content, no template is provided here. One of these examples
    may provide a starting point:

      Protocol](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
