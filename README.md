# IETF Repo Files

This repository contains files and templates for [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)
working group chairs and participants to use in GitHub repositories used for
IETF work.

  * [`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md) is the official boilerplate text to be included
    in all IETF repositories, per the [IETF
    Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org/license-for-open-source-repositories.html).
    (Automatically updated.)

  * [`NOTE-WELL.md`](NOTE-WELL.md) is the text of the [IETF note
    well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) as Markdown, if you should need
    it. (Automatically updated.)

  * It is customary to include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in a repo that explains
    how individuals can participate in the activities and contains additional
    useful information for participants to be aware of. Due to the specific
    nature of the content, no template is provided here. One of these examples
    may provide a starting point:

    * ACME Working Group: [ACME
      Protocol](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    * CORE Working Group:
      [OSCOAP](https://github.com/core-wg/oscoap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
      [multipart-core](https://github.com/core-wg/multipart-ct/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    * HTTP Working Group:
      [Extensions](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    * QUIC Working Group: [Base
      Drafts](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    * TLS Working Group: [TLS
      1.3](https://github.com/tlswg/tls13-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    * Martin Thomson's
      [i-d-template](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template):
      [template](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/template/CONTRIBUTING.md)

  * Some IETF participants have created an automated service that can email
    activity reports, issue summaries and other information about GitHub
    activity to mailing lists. This is typically appreciated by IETF
    participants that do not actively follow GitHub discussions and activities
    very closely. See [IETF Repository Data
    Service](https://github.com/ietf-github-services/repo-data) on how to get
    started.
